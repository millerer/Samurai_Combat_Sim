Overview:
This is the final project for CS 162. It builds upon the
fantasy combat game we have been making and incorporates
data structures to cycle between two teams of opposing
samurai. The battle function continues until one team
losses all their samurai, then the samurai are ranked
by total wins. The team with the most samurai in the top
three rankings is considered the overall winner.


Output:
CPU controlled turn based combat between teams of three each.
